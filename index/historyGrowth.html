            <h2>The Beginning of Nike</h2>
            <p>The story of this American company began on January 25, 1964, when Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight founded Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), a footwear company based in Eugene, Oregon. Bowerman, a track and field coach at the University of Oregon, and Knight, his former student and a runner, initially focused on distributing Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS) shoes from Japan to the American market. Knight first discovered Onitsuka shoes during a visit to Japan in 1962 and was impressed by their quality. He then partnered with the company to distribute their products in the U.S., and with Bowerman’s support, Blue Ribbon Sports was officially established.</p>

            <h2>The Transition to Nike</h2>
            <p>In the company's early days, Knight handled business operations while Bowerman focused on shoe design. In 1967, Bowerman designed the Tiger Cortez, a running shoe that became highly popular. However, as time passed, tensions emerged between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger due to differing visions for product development and distribution. In 1971, BRS ended its partnership with Onitsuka and started designing and manufacturing its own shoes. The company rebranded as Nike, Inc., inspired by Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. The name was suggested by Jess Johnson, the company’s first employee. Around the same time, Nike introduced its now-iconic Swoosh logo, designed by Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student at Portland State University. Representing speed and movement, the logo initially earned Davidson just $35, though she later received Nike shares as a token of appreciation.</p>

            <h2>Global Success</h2>
            <p>In 1972, Nike debuted its first shoe featuring the Swoosh logo at the US Track and Field Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon. By 1978, the company had officially adopted the name Nike, Inc., and in 1980, it became a publicly traded company. Over time, Nike expanded rapidly, competing with German sports giants like Adidas and Puma, which had long dominated the market. Through continuous innovation and strong marketing strategies, Nike has solidified itself as a global leader in the sports footwear and apparel industry, shaping the future of athletic performance and fashion.
