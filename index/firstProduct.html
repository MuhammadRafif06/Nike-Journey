        <h1>The First Nike Product: A Revolutionary Beginning</h1>
        <p>Nike is one of the most recognized and influential sportswear brands in the world today. However, its journey began with a single product that set the foundation for its success.</p>

            <h2>Origins of Nike</h2>
            <p>Nike was founded as <span class="highlight">"Blue Ribbon Sports"</span> (BRS) in 1964 by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman. Initially, BRS acted as a distributor for Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS), selling Japanese-made running shoes in the United States. However, tensions arose, and Knight and Bowerman decided to create their own line of athletic footwear.</p>

            <p>In 1971, Blue Ribbon Sports rebranded as <span class="highlight">Nike</span>, named after the Greek goddess of victory. Along with the new name came its first independent product—the <span class="highlight">Nike Cortez</span>. Designed by Bill Bowerman, the Cortez was developed with the goal of providing superior comfort, durability, and performance for runners.</p>
