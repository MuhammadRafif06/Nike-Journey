            <h2>Nike's Evolution</h2>
            <p>From a small distributor to a globally recognized independent brand, Nike has continuously evolved through innovation and strategic moves that have solidified its position in the sports industry. These changes go beyond the products they create, encompassing design, technology, and marketing approaches. Nike consistently introduces groundbreaking innovations and collaborates with various entities, further strengthening its global presence.</p>
            <p>One of Nike's most renowned innovations is Air technology, introduced through the Nike Air Max. First launched in 1978, this technology features air cushioning in the shoe's sole to enhance comfort and athletic performance. Additionally, Nike developed Flyknit technology, allowing for lighter, more flexible, and environmentally friendly footwear. Other innovations include Nike React, which provides more responsive cushioning for runners and athletes.</p>
            <p>Beyond technology, Nike is also known for collaborations with athletes and iconic figures. One of the most significant partnerships in Nike’s history is with Michael Jordan, resulting in the highly successful Air Jordan line. The brand has also worked with athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James to develop products tailored to their needs.</p>
