    <header>Growth of Nike:  From Innovation to Icon – Shaping Sports, Fashion, and Culture</header>

      <h2>Nike's Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        From a small distributor to a globally recognized independent brand,
        Nike has grown through continuous innovation and strategic decisions.
        Its evolution extends beyond just products, encompassing advancements
        in design, technology, and marketing. By consistently pushing
        boundaries, Nike has strengthened its position in the sports industry.
        Collaborations with various entities have further expanded its global
        influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Nike's most groundbreaking innovations is Air technology,
        introduced in 1978 with the Nike Air Max. This cushioning system,
        embedded in the shoe’s sole, enhances both comfort and athletic
        performance. Nike also developed Flyknit technology, which provides
        lightweight, flexible, and sustainable footwear. Another major
        innovation is Nike React, designed to offer better energy return and
        responsiveness for athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond technological advancements, Nike has built its legacy through
        collaborations with top athletes and cultural icons. One of its most
        successful partnerships is with Michael Jordan, leading to the
        creation of the iconic Air Jordan line. Nike has also worked with
        world-class athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, Kobe
        Bryant, and LeBron James. These collaborations help develop
        specialized products that meet the demands of elite sports
        professionals.

      <h2>Michael Jordan: The Birth of a Basketball Legend</h2>
      <div class="collaboration-box">

        <p>
          The year 1984 marked a turning point in both Nike and sports
          history. That year, Nike made a bold move by signing a sponsorship
          deal with rookie NBA player Michael Jordan, who was not yet a
          household name. This collaboration led to the creation of the
          legendary Air Jordan sneaker line, combining athletic performance
          with an iconic style.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="jordan-box">
        <p>The Air Jordan 1, featuring a black and red color scheme, caused immediate controversy. At the time, NBA
          regulations required players to wear primarily white sneakers that matched their team uniforms. Since the Air
          Jordan 1 violated this rule, then-NBA commissioner David Stern fined Jordan $5,000 every time he wore them on
          the court.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/air jordan banned.jpg" alt="img">
        <p>Instead of suppressing interest, the ban fueled hype. The media covered Jordan’s defiance of the NBA’s rigid
          rules, and Nike cleverly turned this controversy into a marketing strategy. Advertisements highlighting the
          NBA’s ban and Jordan’s fines only boosted the sneaker’s popularity, making the Air Jordan 1 a symbol of
          rebellion, style, and performance.

          Despite the fines, Nike willingly covered the costs to support Jordan and the Air Jordan 1. This strategic
          risk paid off immensely. The controversy propelled Air Jordan sales to new heights, turning Michael Jordan
          into a global icon, not just in basketball but also in fashion.

          The partnership between Nike and Michael Jordan remains one of the most successful athlete sponsorships in
          history. Nike established a sneaker brand that excelled in both performance and fashion, while Jordan gained a
          sponsor that fueled his success on and off the court.</p>

          <p>
            In 2017, Virgil Abloh redefined sneaker culture by collaborating

            iconic Nike silhouettes, including the Air Jordan 1 and Air Max
            90, blending high fashion with streetwear. Abloh’s signature
            design elements, such as zip ties and quotation marks, made the
            collection an instant hit. Even after his passing, his influence
            on sneaker design remains strong, with Off-White collaborations
            continuing to be highly sought after.

            collaborations seamlessly blend skate culture with streetwear,
            appealing to sneaker collectors worldwide. In 2025, Nike and

            sought-after designs like the Air Force 1 “Cactus Jack” and the
            Air Jordan 1 Retro High “Cactus Jack.” His signature reverse Nike

            the Air Yeezy 2 in 2012, further solidifying Kanye’s influence in
            the sneaker industry. Despite its success, Kanye eventually left
            Nike due to creative differences and later took his Yeezy brand to
            Adidas.

          Nike played a crucial role in supporting Kipchoge, equipping him with innovative running shoes that enhanced
          his performance.
          Kipchoge’s journey continues to inspire athletes worldwide, demonstrating the power of determination and
